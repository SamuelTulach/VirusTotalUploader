#### Download (<a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net46-web-installer"><img alt="GitHub release" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Requires-.NET%20Framework%204.6%20(or later)-blue"></a>)
Please go to [releases page](https://github.com/firepacket/VirusTotalUploader/releases) to download <b>the single .exe file</b>!

#### How to get API key
<b>If you don't have an API key, the application will still work using a different method!</b>
But if you get one, your experience will be better! All you need to do is to go to [VirusTotal official page](https://www.virustotal.com/), create profile and copy your key into Settings.<br/>

#### How to use
It is really easy! Just drag and drop file into the app and voila! Or right-click any file and select "Virus Total Uploader".</br>
Click on settings to add Context Menu (right-click) support and Auto-Upload</br>
Click "Reset" to uninstall if you want to move the .exe, or you can move it, click "Reset" and "Save" again for the Context Menu.

#### New Undocumented Feature
If you create a String value in *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Classes\*\shell\Virus Total Uploader\* name it "Browser" and set the value to a different browser .exe path (no quotes) that you want to use.<br/>
<b>NOTE: You can only do this if you have enabled Context Menu!</b> It was to just keep things tidy for a feature most people won't use, just for me.
